### What is SOLID?

Solid acronym for design principles. 
 - Single responsibility 
 - Open-closed 
 - Liskov substitution 
 - Interface segregation 
 - Dependency inversion

Not a framework
Not a library
Not a pattern
Not a goal

Most codebases today are procedural in nature even though they are written in OO language. SOLID is knowns a priciples of Object Oriented Design. When you apply those priciples you arrive at OO design.

The purpose of SOLID is to make you **more productive** by making **code more maintainable** through **decomposition** and **decoupling**.

Design smells that SOLID tends to address:
- Regiditiy - the design is *difficult to change*
- Fragility - the design is *easy to break*
- Immobility - the design is *difficult to reuse*
- Viscosity - it's difficult to *do the right thing*
- Needless complexity - overdesign


Needless complexity 
SRP - instead of being general be specific. Following SRP, each concrete class is very specific. 

#### Role interface 
Interfaces that are discovered after you have implemented some of the business logic. *Interfaces are not designed they are discovered as the system grows.*
